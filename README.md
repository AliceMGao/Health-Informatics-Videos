In Information Technology I for December 2019, my group and I were tasked to take apart a medical device and explain it in full, from history, to everyday use, and its technical inner workings; our device of choice was a Freestyle Lite blood glucose monitor. This <a href="https://youtu.be/exXgOQmR8s4">video</a> was taken with my Nikon D5300.
